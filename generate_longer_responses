Generating Longer Responses
To get longer responses to complex questions, set n_ctx to a larger number to increase the number of tokens the large language model uses for context, then remove the max_tokens limit for the query. While this allows longer responses, it can significantly increase the total time required to generate a response.

from llama_cpp import Llama

# define n_ctx manually to permit larger contexts
LLM = Llama(model_path="./llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", n_ctx=2048)

# create a text prompt
prompt = "Q: Why are Jupyter notebooks difficult to maintain? A:"

# set max_tokens to 0 to remove the response size limit
output = LLM(prompt, max_tokens=0)

# display the response
print(output["choices"][0]["text"])
It took my system 1.5 minutes to generate this response:
